# 📝 ToDo System Project

This repository contains a full-stack **To-Do System** with:
- ✅ A **Flutter User App** (Mobile/Web)
- ✅ A **React Admin Panel** (Next.js + Firebase)

Both apps are connected to a shared Firebase backend for real-time task management.

## 🚀 Features

### 👤 Flutter User App
- Add, view, and mark tasks as completed
- Modern, responsive UI with animations
- Confirmation dialogs and hover effects (web)

### 🧑‍💼 React Admin Panel
- Full CRUD on tasks
- Animated UI with light theme
- Realtime updates via Firebase Firestore

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js + npm for admin panel
- Flutter SDK for user app

---

### 🔥 Firebase Setup (Shared)

Both apps use the same Firebase project:
- Firestore database (collection: `todos`)
- No authentication is enforced (for demo purposes)

> **⚠️ Firebase Config Exposure**
>
> This project includes the `firebaseConfig` object in both apps. This is **safe** for frontend-only apps using Firebase, because:
>
> - It **does not expose sensitive credentials** like private keys.
> - Firebase projects use **security rules** to control access — that’s where you define who can read/write.
>
> ✅ Even if someone has your `firebaseConfig`, they cannot access your database unless your [Firestore Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) allow it.

Still, in production, it is **recommended** to:
- Use authentication (Firebase Auth or custom auth)
- Harden Firestore security rules

---

## 🧪 Running the Apps

### Flutter App

```bash
cd flutter_todo_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
React Admin Panel

cd todo-admin-panel
npm install
npm run dev
Then visit: http://localhost:3000

🛡️ Security Notes
This is a demo project, so:

No authentication

Rules are relaxed for read/write

Ensure you tighten these before deploying
